# open-climate

A resource for climate activists of all ages. Resources, projects, and initiatives that have been vetted by those active in open science and climate action. We want to acknowledge the problems, but focus on solutions. In all interactions, please adhere to our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Contributing

For now, we want to collect as many resources as we can in this repository. The idea is to eventually curate these resources as a community and turn it all into a website. For now:

1. Open an issue highlighting the resource or resources you wish to add and why.
2. Once approved, add it to these README via a pull request under the relevant heading.
3. Join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ty3RytTxCR).
